# 🐍 **Python Fundamentals – Developer Job Readiness Guide**

This guide is structured to help you **learn Python fundamentals** with a focus on **real-world applications**, preparing you for **entry-level developer jobs**. Each section includes **what to say**, **hands-on exercises**, **project ideas**, and **job-ready tips**.

---

## 📚 **Class Plan Overview**
- **Objective:** Build a strong Python foundation for job readiness.  
- **Duration:** ~2 hours  
- **Tools Needed:** Python installed on computers, IDEs (VS Code, PyCharm), or an online Python editor (e.g., [Repl.it](https://repl.it))  
- **Outcome:** Understand variables, control flow, loops, functions, basic data types, and build a mini-project portfolio.

## 🧠 **1. Why Learn Python for Developer Jobs? (10 mins)**

### 🗣️ **What to Say:**
*"Python is one of the most in-demand programming languages in fields like web development, data science, automation, and AI. Companies love Python because it’s powerful and easy to use."*

### ✅ **Key Industry Applications:**
1. **Web Development:** Frameworks like Django, Flask.  
2. **Data Analysis:** Libraries like Pandas, NumPy.  
3. **Automation:** Scripts to save time on repetitive tasks.  
4. **AI & Machine Learning:** TensorFlow, PyTorch.  

### 🛠️ **Demo: Hello, World!**
1. Open an IDE or online editor.  
2. Type:
   ```python
   print("Hello, World! Welcome to Python Development!")
   ```
3. **Explain:**
   - `print()` is a core function.
   - Text is wrapped in **quotation marks**.

### 🧠 **Ask Students:**
- *“What areas of development interest you most?”*
- *“Have you ever seen a job description requiring Python skills?”*

## 🛠️ **2. Setting Up a Developer Environment (10 mins)**

### 🗣️ **What to Say:**
*"Professional developers use powerful tools like **Visual Studio Code**, **PyCharm**, and **Git** to manage their projects."*

### ✅ **Set Up Tools:**
1. Install **Python 3.x** from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).  
2. Install **Visual Studio Code** or **PyCharm Community Edition**.  
3. Install **Git** for version control ([git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/)).

### 🛠️ **Student Activity:**
- Open VS Code and create a Python script:
   ```python
   print("Python Environment Ready!")
   ```

### ✅ **Pro Tip:**  
- Use virtual environments:  
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # Mac/Linux
   env\Scripts\activate     # Windows
   ```

## 🏷️ **3. Variables and Data Types (15 mins)**

### 🗣️ **What to Say:**
*"Variables store data, and Python automatically knows what type of data you’re working with."*

### ✅ **Common Data Types:**
- **String (`str`)**: Text, `"Hello"`
- **Integer (`int`)**: Whole numbers, `42`
- **Float (`float`)**: Decimals, `3.14`
- **Boolean (`bool`)**: True/False, `True`

### 🛠️ **Example Code:**
```python
name = "Jeff"
age = 30
salary = 55000.50
is_developer = True

print(f"{name} is {age} years old and earns ${salary}. Developer: {is_developer}")
```

### 🛠️ **Student Activity:**
- Create variables for:
   - Your favorite programming language.
   - Your dream job title.
- Print them using an f-string.

## 🔢 **4. Basic Operations and Real-World Tasks (10 mins)**

### ✅ **Math Operations:**
```python
salary = 55000
bonus = 5000
total_income = salary + bonus
print("Total Income:", total_income)
```

### ✅ **Real-World Example: Automating Salary Calculation**
```python
hours_worked = 160
hourly_rate = 25
monthly_income = hours_worked * hourly_rate
print("Monthly Income:", monthly_income)
```

### 🛠️ **Student Activity:**
- Write a program to calculate your **monthly savings** after deducting rent and utilities.

---

## 🔄 **5. Control Flow for Decision Making (15 mins)**

### 🗣️ **What to Say:**
*"Control flow helps programs make decisions and repeat tasks efficiently."*

### ✅ **If-Else Example:**
```python
age = 25
if age >= 18:
    print("Eligible for a developer job.")
else:
    print("Focus on learning!")
```

### ✅ **For Loop Example:**
```python
for i in range(1, 6):
    print(f"Application #{i} sent!")
```

### ✅ **While Loop Example:**
```python
attempts = 0
while attempts < 3:
    print("Retrying connection...")
    attempts += 1
```

### 🛠️ **Student Activity:**
- Write a program that categorizes ages:
   - Below 18: *"Student"*
   - 18–25: *"Junior Developer"*
   - Above 25: *"Senior Developer"*

---

## 📦 **6. Functions – Reusable Code (10 mins)**

### ✅ **Example:**
```python
def greet_user(name):
    return f"Welcome, {name}!"

print(greet_user("Jeff"))
```

### ✅ **Real-World Example: Automating Emails**
```python
def send_email(recipient):
    print(f"Email sent to {recipient}")
```

### 🛠️ **Student Activity:**
- Write a function that calculates annual income given `monthly_salary`.

---

## 🛠️ **7. Real-World Mini Project: Job Application Tracker (20 mins)**

### ✅ **Objective:**
Create a script to track job applications.

```python
jobs_applied = []

def add_job(job_title, company):
    jobs_applied.append({"title": job_title, "company": company})

def list_jobs():
    for job in jobs_applied:
        print(f"Applied to {job['title']} at {job['company']}")

add_job("Python Developer", "TechCorp")
list_jobs()
```
